## Chapter 1 -  Clean Code
</a>
This Book is about good programming. It's about how to write good code, and how to transform bad code into good code.

The code represents the detail of the requirements and the details cannot be ignored or abstracted. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. We can create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precision. 

### Why write bad code?
- Are you in a rush?
- Do you try to go "fast"?
- Do not you have time to do a good job?
- Are you tired of work in the same program/module?
- Does your Boss push you to finish soon?  

The previous arguments could create a swamp of senseless code.

If you say "I will back to fix it later" you could fall in the [LeBlanc's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AList_of_eponymous_laws#Proposal_to_add_LeBlanc.27s_law) "Later equals never"

You are a professional and the code is your responsibility. Let's analyze the following anecdote:

> What if you were a doctor and had a patient who demanded that you stop all the silly hand-washing in preparation for surgery because it was taking too much time? Clearly the patient is the boss; and yet the doctor should absolutely refuse to comply. Why? Because the doctor knows more than the patient about the risks of disease and infection. It would be unprofessional (never mind criminal) for the doctor to  comply with the patient.

So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.

Maybe sometime you think in go fast to make the deadline. The only way to go fast is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

### What is Clean Code?
Each experimented programmer has his/her own definition of clean code, but something is clear, a clean code is a code that you can read easily. The clean code is code that has been taken care of.

In his book Uncle Bob says the next:

> Consider this book a description of the Object Mentor School of Clean Code. The techniques and teachings within are the way that we practice our art. We are willing to claim that if you follow these teachings, you will enjoy the benefits that we have enjoyed, and you will learn to write code that is clean and professional. But don’t make the mistake of thinking that we are somehow “right” in any absolute sense. There are other schools and other masters that have just as much claim to professionalism as we. It would behoove you to learn from them as well.

### The boy Scout Rule
It’s not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time. We have all seen code rot and degrade as time passes. So we must take an active role in preventing this degradation.

It's a good practice apply the [Boy Scout Rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule)

> Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

## Chapter 2 -  Meaningful Names
</a>

Names are everywhere in software. Files, directories, variables functions, etc. Because we do so much of it. We have better do it well.

### Use Intention-Revealing Names
It is easy to say that names reveal intent. Choosing good names takes time, but saves more than it takes. So take care with your names and change them when you find better ones.

The name of a variable, function or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how is used. **If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveals its intent**.  

| Does not reveals intention     | Reveals intention     |
| -------------                  | -------------         |
|`int d; // elapsed time in days`|`int elapsedTimeInDays`|

Choosing names that reveal intent can make much easier to understand and change code. Example:

```java
public List<int[]> getThem() {
  List<int[]> list1 = new ArrayList<int[]>();
  for (int[] x : theList)
    if (x[0] == 4)
      list1.add(x);
  return list1;
}
```
This code is simple, but create many questions:
1. What is the content of `theList`?
2. What is the significance of the item `x[0]` in the list?.
3. Why we compare `x[0]` vs `4`?
4. How would i use the returned list?

The answers to these questions are not present in the code sample, but they could have been. Say that we’re working in a mine sweeper game. We can refactor the previous code as follows:

```java
public List<int[]> getFlaggedCells() {
  List<int[]> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<int[]>();
  for (int[] cell : gameBoard)
    if (cell[STATUS_VALUE] == FLAGGED)
      flaggedCells.add(cell);
  return flaggedCells;
}
```

Now we know the next information:
1. `theList` represents the `gameBoard`
2. `x[0]` represents a cell in the board and `4` represents a flagged cell
3. The returned list represents the `flaggedCells`

Notice that the simplicity of the code has not changed. It still has exactly the same number of operators and constants, with exactly the same number of nesting levels. But the code has become much more explicit.

We can improve the code writing a simple class for cells instead of using an array of `ints`. It can include an **intention-revealing function** (called it `isFlagged`) to hide the magic numbers. It results in a new function of the function.

```java
public List<Cell> getFlaggedCells() {
  List<Cell> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<Cell>();
  for (Cell cell : gameBoard)
    if (cell.isFlagged())
      flaggedCells.add(cell);
  return flaggedCells;
}
```

### Avoid Disinformation

Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. We should avoid words whose entrenched meaning vary from our intended meaning.

Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an `accountList` unless it's actually a `List`. The word `List` means something specific to programmers. If the container holding the accounts is not actually a List, it may lead to false conclusions. So `accountGroup` or `bunchOfAccounts` or just plain `accounts` would be better.

Beware of using names which vary in small ways. How long does it take to spot the subtle difference between a `XYZControllerForEfficientHandlingOfStrings ` in one module and, somewhere a little more distant, `XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings`? The words have frightfully similar shapes

### Make Meaningful Distinctions
Programmers create problems for themselves when they write code solely to satisfy a compiler or interpreter. For example because you can't use the same name to refer two different things in the same scope, you might be tempted to change one name in an arbitrary way. Sometimes this is done by misspelling one, leading to the surprising situation where correcting spelling errors leads to an inability to compile. Example, you create the variable `klass`because the name `class` was used for something else.

In the next function, the arguments are noninformative, `a1` and `a2` doesn't provide clues to the author intention.

```java
public static void copyChars(char a1[], char a2[]) {
  for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++) {
    a2[i] = a1[i];
  }
}
```

We can improve the code selecting more explicit argument names: 
```java
public static void copyChars(char source[], char destination[]) {
  for (int i = 0; i < source.length; i++) {
    destination[i] = source[i];
  }
}
```

Noise words are another meaningless distinction. Imagine that you have a Product class. If you have another called `ProductInfo ` or `ProductData`, you have made the names different without making them mean anything different. Info and Data are indistinct noise words like a, an, and the.

Noise words are redundant. The word variable should never appear in a variable name. The word table should never appear in a table name.

### Use Pronounceable Names
Imagine you have the variable `genymdhms` (Generation date, year, month, day, hour, minute and second) and imagine a conversation where you need talk about this variable calling it  "gen why emm dee aich emm ess". You can consider convert a class like this:

```java
class DtaRcrd102 {
  private Date genymdhms;
  private Date modymdhms;
  private final String pszqint = "102";
  /* ... */
};
```

 To

```java
class Customer {
  private Date generationTimestamp;
  private Date modificationTimestamp;;
  private final String recordId = "102";
  /* ... */
};
```

### Use Searchable Names
Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of text.

### Avoid Encoding
We have enough encodings to deal with without adding more to our burden. Encoding type or scope information into names simply adds an extra burden of deciphering. Encoded names are seldom pronounceable and are easy to mis-type. An example of this, is the use of the [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) or the use of member prefixes.

#### Interfaces and Implementations

These are sometimes a special case for encodings. For example, say you are building an ABSTRACT FACTORY for the creation of shapes. This factory will be an interface and will be implemented by a concrete class. What should you name them? `IShapeFactory` and `ShapeFactory`? Is preferable to leave interfaces unadorned.I don’t want my users knowing that I’m handing them an interface. I just want them to know that it’s a `ShapeFactory`. So if I must encode either the interface or the implementation, I choose the implementation. Calling it `ShapeFactoryImp`, or even the hideous `CShapeFactory`, is preferable to encoding the interface.


### Avoid Mental Mapping
Readers shouldn't have to mentally translate your names into other names they already know.

One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.

### Class Names
Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like `Customer`, `WikiPage`, `Account`, and `AddressParser`. Avoid words like `Manager`,`Processor`, `Data`, or `Info ` in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.

### Method Names
Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like `postPayment`, `deletePage` or `save`. Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with get, set, and is according to the javabean standard.

When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that describe the arguments. For example:

```java
Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);
```
Is generally better than

```java
Complex fulcrumPoint = new Complex(23.0);
```

Consider enforcing their use by making the corresponding constructors private.

### Don't Be Cute

| Cute name         | Clean name   |
| -------------     | -------------|
| `holyHandGranade` |`deleteItems` |
| `whack`           | `kill`       |
| `eatMyShorts`     | `abort`      |

### Pick one word per concept
Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it’s confusing to have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes.

### Don’t Pun
Avoid using the same word for two purposes. Using the same term for two different ideas is essentially a pun.

Example: in a class use `add` for create a new value by adding or concatenating two existing values and in another class use `add` for put a simple parameter in a collection, it's a better options use a name like `insert` or `append` instead.

### Use Solution Domain Names
Remember that the people who read your code will be programmers. So go ahead and use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth.

### Use Problem Domain Names
When there is no “programmer-eese” for what you’re doing, use the name from the problem domain. At least the programmer who maintains your code can ask a domain expert what it means.

### Add Meaningful context
There are a few names which are meaningful in and of themselves—most are not. Instead, you need to place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named classes, functions, or namespaces. When all else fails, then prefixing the name may be necessary as a last resort

Variables like: `firstName`, `lastName`, `street`, `city`, `state`. Taken together it's pretty clear that they form an address, but, what if you saw the variable state being used alone in a method?, you could add context using prefixes like: `addrState` at least readers will understand that the variable is part of a large structure. Of course, a better solution is to create a class named `Address` then even the compiler knows that the variables belong to a bigger concept

### Don’t Add Gratuitous Context
In an imaginary application called “Gas Station Deluxe,” it is a bad idea to prefix every class with GSD. Example: `GSDAccountAddress`

Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear. Add no more context to a name than is necessary.

## Chapter 3 -  Functions
</a>

Functions are the first line of organization in any topic.

### Small!!
The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.

#### Blocks and Indenting
This implies that the blocks within `if` statements, `else` statements, `while` statements, and so on should be one line long. Probably that line should be a function call. Not only does this keep the enclosing function small, but also adds documentary value because the function called within the block can have a nicely descriptive name.

This also implies that functions should not be large enough to hold nested structures. Therefore, the indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two. This, of course, makes the functions easy to read and understand. 

### Do One Thing

**FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY.**

#### Sections within Functions

If you have a function divided in sections like *declarations*, *initialization* etc, it's a obvious symptom of the function is doing more than one thing. Functions that do one thing cannot be reasonably divided into sections.

### One Level of Abstraction per Function

In order to make sure our functions are doing "one thing", we need to make sure that the statements within our function are all at the same level of abstraction.

#### Reading Code from Top to Bottom: *The Stepdown Rule*
We want the code to read like a top-down narrative. 5 We want every function to be followed by those at the next level of abstraction so that we can read the program, descending one level of abstraction at a time as we read down the list of functions. 

To say this differently, we want to be able to read the program as though it were a set
of TO paragraphs, each of which is describing the current level of abstraction and referencing subsequent TO paragraphs at the next level down.

```
- To include the setups and teardowns, we include setups, then we include the test page content, and then we include the teardowns.
- To include the setups, we include the suite setup if this is a suite, then we include the regular setup.
- To include the suite setup, we search the parent hierarchy for the “SuiteSetUp” page and add an include statement with the path of that page.
- To search the parent...
```

It turns out to be very difficult for programmers to learn to follow this rule and write functions that stay at a single level of abstraction. But learning this trick is also very important. It is the key to keeping functions short and making sure they do “one thing.” Making the code read like a top-down set of TO paragraphs is an effective technique for keeping the abstraction level consistent.

### Switch Statements
It’s hard to make a small switch statement. 6 Even a switch statement with only two cases is larger than I’d like a single block or function to be. It’s also hard to make a switch statement that does one thing. By their nature, switch statements always do N things. Unfortunately we can’t always avoid switch statements, but we can make sure that each switch statement is buried in a low-level class and is never repeated. We do this, of course, with polymorphism.

### Use Descriptive Names

> You know you are working on clean code when each routine turns out to be pretty much what you expected

Half the battle to achieving that principle is choosing good names for small functions that do one thing. The smaller and more focused a function is, the easier it is to choose a descriptive name.

Don’t be afraid to make a name long. A long descriptive name is better than a short enigmatic name. A long descriptive name is better than a long descriptive comment. Use a naming convention that allows multiple words to be easily read in the function names, and then make use of those multiple words to give the function a name that says what it does. 

Choosing descriptive names will clarify the design of the module in your mind and help you to improve it. It is not at all uncommon that hunting for a good name results in a favorable restructuring of the code.

### Function arguments
The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic). Next comes one (monadic), followed closely by two (dyadic). Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible. More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway.

Arguments are even harder from a testing point of view. Imagine the difficulty of writing all the test cases to ensure that all the various combinations of arguments work properly. If there are no arguments, this is trivial. If there’s one argument, it’s not too hard. With two arguments the problem gets a bit more challenging. With more than two arguments, testing every combination of appropriate values can be daunting.

Output arguments are harder to understand than input arguments. When we read a function, we are used to the idea of information going in to the function through arguments and out through the return value. We don’t usually expect information to be going out through the arguments. So output arguments often cause us to do a double-take.

#### Common Monadic Forms
There are two very common reasons to pass a single argument into a function. You may be asking a question about that argument, as in `boolean fileExists(“MyFile”)` . Or you may be operating on that argument, transforming it into something else and returning it. For example, `InputStream fileOpen(“MyFile”)` transforms a file name `String` into an `InputStream` return value. These two uses are what readers expect when they see a function. You should choose names that make the distinction clear, and always use the two forms in a consistent context.

#### Flag Arguments
Flag arguments are ugly. Passing a boolean into a function is a truly terrible practice. It immediately complicates the signature of the method, loudly proclaiming that this function does more than one thing. It does one thing if the flag is `true` and another if the flag is `false`!

#### Dyadic Functions
A function with two arguments is harder to understand than a monadic function. For example, `writeField(name)` is easier to understand than `writeField(output-Stream, name)`

There are times, of course, where two arguments are appropriate. For example, `Point p = new Point(0,0);` is perfectly reasonable. Cartesian points naturally take two arguments.

Even obvious dyadic functions like assertEquals(expected, actual) are problematic. How many times have you put the actual where the expected should be? The two arguments have no natural ordering. The expected, actual ordering is a convention that requires practice to learn.


Dyads aren’t evil, and you will certainly have to write them. However, you should be aware that they come at a cost and should take advantage of what mechanims may be available to you to convert them into monads. For example, you might make the writeField method a member of outputStream so that you can say outputStream. writeField(name) . Or you might make the outputStream a member variable of the current class so that you don’t have to pass it. Or you might extract a new class like FieldWriter that takes the outputStream in its constructor and has a write method.

#### Triads
Functions that take three arguments are significantly harder to understand than dyads. The issues of ordering, pausing, and ignoring are more than doubled. I suggest you think very carefully before creating a triad.

#### Argument Objects
Compare:  
```java
Circle makeCircle(double x, double y, double radius);
```
vs
```java
Circle makeCircle(Point center, double radius);
```
#### Verbs and Keywords
Choosing good names for a function can go a long way toward explaining the intent of the function and the order and intent of the arguments. In the case of a monad, the function and argument should form a very nice verb/noun pair. For example, `write(name)` is very evocative. Whatever this “name” thing is, it is being “written.” An even better name might be `writeField(name)` , which tells us that the "name" thing is a "field".

This last is an example of the keyword form of a function name. Using this form we encode the names of the arguments into the function name. For example, `assertEquals` might be better written as `assertExpectedEqualsActual(expected, actual)`. This strongly mitigates the problem of having to remember the ordering of the arguments.

### Output Arguments
In general output arguments should be avoided. If your function must change the state of something, have it change the state of its owning object.

### Command Query Separation

Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both. Either your function should change the state of an object, or it should return some information about that object. Doing both often leads to confusion.

### Prefer Exceptions to Returning Error Codes
Returning error codes from command functions is a subtle violation of command query separation.

### Don't Repeat Yourself
Duplication may be the root of all evil in software. Many principles and practices have been created for the purpose of controlling or eliminating it.

### Structured Programming
Some programmers follow Edsger Dijkstra’s rules of structured programming. Dijkstra said that every function, and every block within a function, should have one entry and one exit. Following these rules means that there should only be one return statement in a function, no `break` or `continue` statements in a loop, and never, *ever*, any `goto` statements.

While we are sympathetic to the goals and disciplines of structured programming, those rules serve little benefit when functions are very small. It is only in larger functions that such rules provide significant benefit.

So if you keep your functions small, then the occasional multiple `return` , `break` , or `continue` statement does no harm and can sometimes even be more expressive than the single-entry, single-exit rule. On the other hand, `goto` only makes sense in large functions, so it should be avoided

## Chapter 4 -  Comments
</a>

Nothing can be quite so helpful as a well-placed comment. Nothing can clutter up a module more than frivolous dogmatic comments. Nothing can be quite so damaging as an old comment that propagates lies and misinformation.

If our programming languages were expressive enough, or if we had the talent to subtly wield those languages to express our intent, we would not need comments very much—perhaps not at all.

### Comments Do Not Make Up for Bad Code
Clear and expressive code with few comments is far superior to cluttered and complex code with lots of comments. Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you’ve made, spend it cleaning that mess.

### Explain Yourself in Code
```java
// Check to see if the employee is eligible for full benefits
if ((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) && (employee.age > 65))
```

vs

```java
if (employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits())
```

### Good Comments
Some comments are necessary or beneficial.  However  the only truly good comment is the comment you found a way not to write.

#### Legal Comments
Sometimes our corporate coding standards force us to write certain comments for legal reasons. For example, copyright and authorship statements are necessary and reasonable things to put into a comment at the start of each source file.

#### Informative Comments
It is sometimes useful to provide basic information with a comment. For example, consider this comment that explains the return value of an abstract method:

```java
// Returns an instance of the Responder being tested.
protected abstract Responder responderInstance();
```

A comment like this can sometimes be useful, but it is better to use the name of the function to convey the information where possible. For example, in this case the comment could be made redundant by renaming the function: `responderBeingTested`.

#### Explanation of Intent
Sometimes a comment goes beyond just useful information about the implementation and provides the intent behind a decision. Example:

```java
public int compareTo(Object o)
{
  if(o instanceof WikiPagePath)
  {
    WikiPagePath p = (WikiPagePath) o;
    String compressedName = StringUtil.join(names, "");
    String compressedArgumentName = StringUtil.join(p.names, "");
    return compressedName.compareTo(compressedArgumentName);
  }
  return 1; // we are greater because we are the right type.
}
```
#### Clarification

Sometimes it is just helpful to translate the meaning of some obscure argument or return value into something that’s readable. In general it is better to find a way to make that argument or return value clear in its own right; but when its part of the standard library, or in code that you cannot alter, then a helpful clarifying comment can be useful.

#### Warning of concequences
Sometimes it is useful to warn other programmers about certain consequences.

```java 
// Don't run unless you
// have some time to kill.
public void _testWithReallyBigFile() {
  writeLinesToFile(10000000);
  response.setBody(testFile);
  response.readyToSend(this);
  String responseString = output.toString();
  assertSubString("Content-Length: 1000000000", responseString);
  assertTrue(bytesSent > 1000000000);
}
```
#### TODO Comments
It is sometimes reasonable to leave “To do” notes in the form of //TODO comments. In the
following case, the TODO comment explains why the function has a degenerate implementation and what that function’s future should be.
```java
//TODO-MdM these are not needed
// We expect this to go away when we do the checkout model
protected VersionInfo makeVersion() throws Exception {
  return null;
}
```

TODO s are jobs that the programmer thinks should be done, but for some reason can’t do at the moment. It might be a reminder to delete a deprecated feature or a plea for someone else to look at a problem. It might be a request for someone else to think of a better name or a reminder to make a change that is dependent on a planned event. Whatever else a TODO might be, it is not an excuse to leave bad code in the system.

#### Amplification
A comment may be used to amplify the importance of something that may otherwise seem inconsequential.

```java
String listItemContent = match.group(3).trim();
// the trim is real important. It removes the starting
// spaces that could cause the item to be recognized
// as another list.
new ListItemWidget(this, listItemContent, this.level + 1);
return buildList(text.substring(match.end()));
```

#### Javadocs in Public APIs
There is nothing quite so helpful and satisfying as a well-described public API. The javadocs for the standard Java library are a case in point. It would be difficult, at best, to write Java programs without them.
